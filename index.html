        <h3>Skills</h3>

        <div class="skill">
          <h4>Java</h4>
          <p>Java is the language I have used the most.  I started programming with it in back in high school.  
            Since then I have regularly used it in university courses and personal projects.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="skill">
          <h4>Python</h4>
          <p>I first started using this language in university.  It is one of my favorite languages to work in for its easy setup and usage,

          <h4>MySQL</h4>
          <p>Any time I have needed to query a database in my projects, I have used MySQL.  
            My skills are more in querying databases than creating and editing them, 
            but I always enjoy figuring out how to build better queries and commands in MySQL.</p>

        <h3>Technology Interests</h3>

        <div class="interest">
          <h4>Networking</h4>
          <p>Learning about the many layers of security and error correction that go into the way devices communicate 
            is always interesting.  Thinking about the insane amount of communication, and verification our devices do without us 
            thinking about it amazes me.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="interest">
          <h4>Web Development</h4>
          <p>The creation of software for use from anywhere around the world is incredibly interesing to me.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="interest">
          <h4>Security</h4>
          <p>The importance of computer security is often overlooked due to the fact that most computer users do not really understand it
            (Hacking scenes in movies is proof of this).  Understanding security and the ways we are vulnerable to information gathering/altering is something 
            I'm always interested in learning more about.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="interest">
          <h4>Front End Development</h4>
          <p>Using software with poorly designed front ends is a pet peeve of mine.  Getting the chance to make good ones is something I like to try and do, 
            even if I'm not the best at it yet.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="interest">
          <h4>AI & Machine Learning</h4>
          <p>As AI and machine learning have gotten better over the years, I have continually been impressed as they get more accurate and powerful than I expect.
            Applications like "Deep Fakes" supprised everyone with what it could do.  Learning about the basics in university peaked my interest into what is possible 
            with AI automation.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="interest">
          <h4>Low Level Computing</h4>
          <p>Seeing how computers work at lower levels is what got me interested in computer science to begin with.  Learning how things work behind the scenes has always been
            something I love to do.
